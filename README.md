# 📚 Library Management System in C++

## 📖 Overview:
This project is a Library Management System developed in C++ for efficient handling of books and library operations. It includes features for book management, data storage, and user interaction, making it suitable for educational purposes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **IDE Recommended:** Visual Studio Code
- **Database:** File handling for data storage

## 🎯 Features:
- **📖 Book Management:**
  - Add new books with details (ID, Name, Authors, Price).
  - Update existing book details.
  - Delete books from the system.
  - Search books by ID or Name.
  - Display all books.

- **💰 Price Management:**
  - View books with the highest and lowest prices.

- **📦 Data Management:**
  - Save book data to a file.
  - Load book data from a file.

## 📦 Project Structure:
- **`main.cpp`**: The core file handling all book operations.
- **`Book.h`**: Definition of the `Book` struct.
- **`Library.cpp`**: Functions for inserting, updating, deleting, and searching books.
- **`data.txt`**: File for storing book records.

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Compile using a C++ compiler (g++ recommended).
4. Run the executable file generated.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the library system.

## 📈 Future Improvements:
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Add user roles (librarian, member).
- Enhance data storage with a database instead of file handling.
